# Pokémon Red, Green, and Blue

This is based on Pret's [disassembly][pokered] of the US releases of Pokémon Red and Blue, with an added Green to stand in for JP Blue

It builds the following games:

- Pokémon Red (English), based on the offical US Pokémon Red that's derived from Japanese Pokémon Red
- Pokémon Blue (English), based on the official US Pokémon Blue that's derived from Japanese Pokémon Green
- Pokémon Green (English), derived from Japanese Pokémon Blue
- Pokémon Blue (Debug version)

In addition to adding Pokémon Green, this build also makes the following changes:

- POKé DOLLS can no longer be used to defeat [Ghost Marowak](https://glitchcity.wiki/Go_past_the_Marowak_ghost_without_a_Silph_Scope).
- East shore tiles will no longer [generate encounters](https://glitchcity.wiki/Old_man_glitch). (Same behavior as Pokémon Yellow)
- Forest tall-grass-with-flowers tiles will now correctly generate encounters. (Side-effect of the above change.)
- Soft Reset button combination is removed.
- The Safari Zone will now let you in if you don't have enough money, but with less than 30 SAFARI BALLs. (Same behavior as Pokémon Yellow)
- The Safari Zone's initial step count is boosted from 500 to 750, allowing for more missteps while trying to find HM03 and the GOLD TEETH.
- The Safari Zone will no longer let you leave [without quitting](https://glitchcity.wiki/Safari_Zone_exit_glitch) the Safari Game. Fainting will also end the Safari Game. (Same fainting behavior as Pokémon Yellow)
- Cycling Road's gate guards will no longer let you sneak by [without a BICYCLE](https://glitchcity.wiki/Go_on_Cycling_Road_without_a_Bicycle).
- [Escaping a trainer encounter](https://glitchcity.wiki/Trainer_escape_glitch) no longer leaves the game in a broken state, whether through use of moves/items or by blacking out to a wild encounter in sight of a trainer.
- Move swapping is no longer possible whle [transformed](https://glitchcity.wiki/Swapping_Transform_moves_glitch). (Same behavior as Pokémon Yellow)
- The Bike Shop salesman no longer leaves [Instant Text Speed](https://glitchcity.wiki/Bike_Shop_instant_text_glitch) turned on. (Same behavior as Pokémon Yellow)
